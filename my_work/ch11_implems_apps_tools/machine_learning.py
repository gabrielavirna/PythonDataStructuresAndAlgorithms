II. Machine learining
=====================
- subfield of AI; we can never truly create machines that actually "think" but we can supply machines with enough data
and models by which sound judgment can be reached. ML focuses on creating autonomous systems that can continue the
process of decision making, with little/no human intervention.

In order to teach the machine, we need data drawn from the real world. For instance, to shift through which e-mails
constitute spam and which ones don't, we need to feed the machine with samples of each. After obtaining this data, we
have to run the data through models (algorithms) that will use probability and statistics to unearth patterns and
structure from the data. If this is properly done, the algorithm by itself will be able to analyze e-mails and properly
categorize them. Sorting e-mails is just one example of what machines can do if they are "trained".

Types of machine learning
-------------------------
There are three broad categories of machine learning:

-> Supervised learning: an algorithm is fed a set of inputs and their corresponding outputs. The algorithm then has to
figure out what the output will be for an unfamiliar input. (naive Bayes, linear regression, decision tree algorithms)

-> Unsupervised learning: Without using the relationship that exists between a set of input and output variables,
the unsupervised learning algorithm uses only the inputs to unearth groups, patterns, and clusters within the data.
(hierarchical clustering and k-means clustering)

-> Reinforcement learning: The computer dynamically interacts with its environment in s way to improve its performance.
