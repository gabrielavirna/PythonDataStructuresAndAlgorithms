Tree
-----
- a hierarchical form of data structure.
-> Lists, queues, and stacks =>  items followed each other.
-> But in a tree, there is a parent-child relationship between items.

Here is a list of terms associated with a Tree:

Node: Each circled alphabet represents a node. A node is any structure that holds data.
Root node: The root node is the only node from which all other nodes come. A tree with an undistinguishable root node
cannot be considered as a tree. The root node in our tree is the node A.
Sub-tree: A sub-tree of a tree is a tree with its nodes being a descendant of some other tree. Nodes F, K, and L form a
sub-tree of the original tree consisting of all the nodes.
Degree: The number of sub-trees of a given node. A tree consisting of only one node has a degree of 0. This one tree
node is also considered as a tree by all standards. The degree of node A is 2.
Leaf node: This is a node with a degree of 0. Nodes J, E, K, L, H, M, and I are all leaf nodes.
Edge: The connection between two nodes. An edge can sometimes connect a node to itself, making the edge appear as a loop.
Parent: A node in the tree with other connecting nodes is the parent of those nodes. Node B is the parent of nodes D,
E, and F.
Child: This is a node connected to its parent. Nodes B and C are children of node A, the parent and root node.
Sibling: All nodes with the same parent are siblings. This makes the nodes B and C siblings.
Level: The level of a node is the number of connections from the root node. The root node is at level 0.
Nodes B and C are at level 1.
Height of a tree: This is the number of levels in a tree. Our tree has a height of 4.
Depth: The depth of a node is the number of edges from the root of the tree to that node.
The depth of node H is 2.
