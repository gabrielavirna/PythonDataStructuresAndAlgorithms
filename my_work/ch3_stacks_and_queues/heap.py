Heaps
-----
- the heap data structure: a specialization of a tree in which the nodes are ordered in a specific way
- Heaps are divided into:
    -> Max heap: each parent node >= to its children => the root node must be the greatest value in the tree
    -> Min heap: each parent node must be <= to both its children => the root node holds the lowest value

- Usage: to implement priority queues; there is a very efficient sorting algorithm: heap sort
