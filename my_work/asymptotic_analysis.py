Asymptotic analysis
-------------------
Algorithm's runtime performance:

Worst case - Use an input that gives the slowest performance
Best case - Use an input that give, the best results
Average case - Assumes the input is random

Need to know the upper and lower bounds: simply create two expressions, one each for the best and worst cases.
