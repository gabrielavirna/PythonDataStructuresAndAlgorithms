# Python Data Structures and Algorithms
This is the code repository for Python Data Structures and Algorithms

Data structures allow you to organize data in a particular way efficiently. They are critical to any problem, provide a complete solution, and act like reusable code. 
In this book, you will learn the essential Python data structures and the most common algorithms.
## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.


The code in this book will require you to run Python 2.7.x or higher. Python's default interactive environment can also be used to run the snippets of code. In order to use other third-party libraries, pip should be installed on your system.
